<h1>Stand with Marc: Fight for Faith and Justice</h1>
<br/><br/>
<p>
Marc is a devout Catholic. He worked for a company in Gainesville, Florida called North Central Florida Hospice, Inc. The company goes by the name of Haven. Haven provides hospice care. Marc's job was to help Haven build ties with the community.
<br/>
During a volunteer workshop, Marc shared his story about his journey into working in hospice. Marc shared about his personal faith and how he felt called by God to do hospice work.
<br/>
After the workshop, Marc was written up and reprimanded. His crime? He talked about God at work. He had offended a prominent volunteer who was a staunch atheist. Marc's manager told him never to talk about God at work again.
